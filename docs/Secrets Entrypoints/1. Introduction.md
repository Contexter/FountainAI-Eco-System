# **1. Introduction**

This guide provides a structured approach for **managing `entrypoint.sh` scripts** and **securely handling secrets** within the FountainAI ecosystem. It introduces:

- **Template-based entrypoint generation** to standardize and scale service deployments.
- **Multiple methods for injecting secrets**, including `.env` files, Docker Secrets, and AWS Secrets Manager.
- **Automated validation** to ensure secrets are correctly injected before a service starts.
- **Rollback mechanisms** to restore previous configurations seamlessly.
- **Logging and tracking** to enhance visibility and auditability.

## **Why This Matters**
Before adopting this structured approach, FountainAI services faced:

- **Security risks** from plaintext credentials.
- **Inconsistent secrets management** across deployments.
- **Challenges in rolling back changes safely**.
- **Limited automation**, leading to error-prone configurations.

This guide addresses these challenges through a **standardized, template-driven approach**.

## **How This Works**
1. **Entrypoint scripts are generated dynamically** using predefined templates.
2. **Secrets are injected securely** from `.env` files, Docker Secrets, or AWS Secrets Manager.
3. **A validation layer ensures all secrets are correctly set** before launching a service.
4. **Rollback mechanisms restore previous versions**, preventing misconfigurations.
5. **Automation streamlines deployments**, ensuring security, consistency, and maintainability.
