# 2. The Template-Based Entrypoint System

## Why Templates Matter
Before using a template-based approach, FountainAI services relied on manually configured `entrypoint.sh` scripts. This led to:

- **Inconsistent secrets management**, causing security vulnerabilities.
- **Increased risk of errors** from manual script modifications.
- **Difficult updates**, requiring changes to multiple services individually.

By shifting to **template-driven automation**, we achieve:

- ✅ **Standardization** – Every service follows the same best practices.
- ✅ **Security** – No hardcoded secrets in scripts.
- ✅ **Flexibility** – Each service can choose the best secrets provider.
- ✅ **Efficiency** – A single template update applies to all services.

## How It Works
Each FountainAI service generates its `entrypoint.sh` **dynamically** from predefined templates. These templates determine how secrets are loaded and injected.

## Template Directory Structure
All templates are stored in `/templates/`, ensuring **scalability** as more services and secrets providers are added:

```
/templates
│── env_based.sh          # Uses .env files for secrets
│── docker_secrets.sh     # Uses Docker Secrets
│── aws_secrets.sh        # Uses AWS Secrets Manager
│── custom_secrets.sh     # Custom user-defined secrets management
```

Services reference these templates dynamically based on **fountainai_secrets_config.json**.
