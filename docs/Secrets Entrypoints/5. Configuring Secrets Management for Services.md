# 5. Configuring Secrets Management for Services

## Why a Central Configuration?
To prevent inconsistencies in how secrets are handled, FountainAI uses a **centralized configuration file**:  
ðŸ“‚ **`fountainai_secrets_config.json`**  
This ensures that all services automatically reference the correct secrets management method.

## Configuration File Structure
The `fountainai_secrets_config.json` file defines which secrets method each service will use:

```json
{
  "action_service": "docker_secrets",
  "central_sequence_service": "env_based",
  "typesense_client_service": "aws_secrets",
  "story_factory_service": "docker_secrets",
  "session_context_service": "env_based"
}
```

## How Services Use This Configuration
Each service dynamically selects its **entrypoint.sh** template based on this file, eliminating manual updates. The configuration file determines:
- **Which secrets management method** is assigned to each service.
- **Ensures services reference the correct templates dynamically.**
- **Prevents misconfiguration** by enforcing a standardized mapping.

### Best Practices for Managing `fountainai_secrets_config.json`
âœ… Keep the configuration **under version control** (Git) to track changes.  
âœ… Validate the JSON structure before deploying to prevent syntax errors.  
âœ… Ensure templates **do not override each other unintentionally**.

## What Happens After Configuration?
Once `fountainai_secrets_config.json` is defined, services will use this mapping when executing `generate_entrypoints.py`, covered in **Chapter 6**.
