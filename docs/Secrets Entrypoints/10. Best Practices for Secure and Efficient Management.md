# 10. Best Practices for Secure and Efficient Management

## Ensuring Security, Efficiency, and Monitoring
To maintain a secure and stable FountainAI system, administrators must follow best practices in:
1. **Managing secrets securely**
2. **Automating deployments**
3. **Monitoring and logging system activity**

## Managing Secrets Securely
### Store Secrets in Secure Locations
✅ **Never hardcode secrets** in `entrypoint.sh`, source code, or Dockerfiles.  
✅ Use one of the following secure storage methods:
   - **Docker Secrets** → `docker secret create`
   - **AWS Secrets Manager** → `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value`
   - **Environment Variables** → Only for local development (`.env` files, excluded via `.gitignore`)

### Rotate and Revoke Secrets Regularly
✅ **Rotate API keys, database passwords, and JWT secrets periodically**.  
✅ Use **IAM roles and policies** to limit secret exposure.  
✅ Enable **automated secret rotation** in AWS Secrets Manager.  
✅ If a secret is compromised, **revoke and replace it immediately** in all affected systems.

## Deployment Best Practices
### Automate Deployment with CI/CD
✅ Use **`run_fountainai.sh`** for **consistent deployments**.  
✅ Integrate **GitHub Actions** or a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.  
✅ Always run `validate_secrets.py` before deploying.

#### Example: GitHub Actions for Deployment
Add the following **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`** file:

```yaml
name: Deploy FountainAI
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"

      - name: Validate Secrets
        run: python3 validate_secrets.py

      - name: Deploy with Docker Compose
        run: |
          chmod +x run_fountainai.sh
          ./run_fountainai.sh
```

✅ This ensures **every commit triggers validation and deployment**.

## Monitoring & Logging Best Practices
### Enable Logging for Debugging
✅ Use `LOG_FILE` in `run_fountainai.sh` to store deployment logs.  
✅ Configure **Docker logging drivers** to forward logs to a centralized system.  

### Forward Logs to a Monitoring System
To send logs to **Prometheus/Grafana**, modify `run_fountainai.sh`:

```sh
docker-compose logs --tail=100 | tee -a fountainai_deployment.log | curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data-binary @- http://monitoring-system.local/logs
```

✅ This will **send logs to a centralized monitoring system** for analysis.
