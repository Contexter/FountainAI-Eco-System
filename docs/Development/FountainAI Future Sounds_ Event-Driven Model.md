# FountainAI Future Sounds: Event-Driven Model

## **Introduction**

FountainAI follows an **event-driven architecture** facilitated by the **Notification Service**. This model enhances system responsiveness, scalability, and modularity by ensuring that services react to critical events dynamically, without requiring direct API polling or synchronous dependencies.

This document outlines **key use cases** for event-driven interactions within the FountainAI ecosystem and how microservices can leverage them for improved efficiency and real-time adaptability.

## **1️⃣ Configuration Updates**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Dynamic Config Updates Without Restart
**Goal:** Ensure services update their configurations in real time when global settings change.

✅ **Example:**  
- A system-wide setting like `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` is modified.
- The **Configuration Service** updates this value in storage.
- It then **sends an event** (`CONFIG_UPDATED`) via the **Notification Service**.
- All relevant services **receive the update and apply it dynamically**.

🚀 **Impact:** No restarts required for configuration changes.

## **2️⃣ Service Health Monitoring & Failover**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Detecting Service Failures & Auto-Healing
**Goal:** Enable proactive monitoring and failover handling when critical services go down.

✅ **Example:**  
- The **Health Check Service** detects that `action-service` is **unresponsive**.
- It **publishes a `SERVICE_DOWN` event**.
- Dependent services:
  - **Switch to a backup instance** (if available).
  - **Enter degraded mode** while waiting for recovery.

🚀 **Impact:** Ensures resilience and high availability.

## **3️⃣ Cache Invalidation & Data Synchronization**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Keeping Cached Data Up-to-Date
**Goal:** Ensure services always operate on fresh data without unnecessary polling.

✅ **Example:**  
- The **Character Service** updates a character’s name.
- It triggers a **`CHARACTER_UPDATED` event**.
- Services that cache character data (`Spoken Word Service`, `Story Factory`) **invalidate their cache and refresh their records**.

🚀 **Impact:** Prevents stale data across the system.

## **4️⃣ User Session Management**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Enforcing Real-Time Session Termination
**Goal:** Ensure session-based security is enforced across all services.

✅ **Example:**  
- A user **logs out** → The **Session Management Service** triggers `USER_LOGGED_OUT`.
- The **Notification Service** informs all microservices to:
  - **Revoke JWT tokens** associated with the session.
  - **Terminate background jobs** tied to the user.

🚀 **Impact:** Enhances security by ensuring immediate session termination.

## **5️⃣ Event-Driven Workflows (Chained Execution)**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Sequential Service Execution Without Hard Dependencies
**Goal:** Allow services to chain processes without blocking execution.

✅ **Example:**  
- A script is created in the **Core Script Management Service**.
- It triggers a **`SCRIPT_CREATED` event**.
- Downstream services react dynamically:
  - **Character Service** initializes character slots.
  - **Story Factory** queues story generation.

🚀 **Impact:** Enables modular workflows without tight service coupling.

## **6️⃣ Automated Scaling & Load Distribution**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Adaptive Scaling Based on Real-Time Traffic
**Goal:** Dynamically allocate resources to handle high-traffic loads.

✅ **Example:**  
- The **Metrics Service** detects a high request rate on `Spoken Word Service`.
- It **triggers `SCALE_UP_SPOKEN_WORD`** via the **Notification Service**.
- The **Orchestration Service** automatically **spins up new instances**.

🚀 **Impact:** Prevents system overload and optimizes resource allocation.

---

## **7️⃣ Background Task Execution Without Blocking API Requests**
### 📌 **Use Case:** Handling Long-Running Processes Asynchronously
**Goal:** Offload intensive tasks to background workers to keep APIs responsive.

✅ **Example:**  
- A user submits an **AI-driven analysis** in the **Story Factory Service**.
- Instead of making the user wait, it triggers `STORY_GENERATION_STARTED`.
- A **background worker** processes the request asynchronously.
- The user gets notified when the process is complete.

🚀 **Impact:** Keeps APIs fast while handling complex workloads efficiently.

## **Conclusion**

The **event-driven model** powered by the **Notification Service** enables:
✔ **Dynamic configuration updates.**
✔ **Proactive failover & auto-healing.**
✔ **Efficient cache invalidation & data sync.**
✔ **Real-time session management.**
✔ **Chained service execution without blocking.**
✔ **Automated scaling & load balancing.**
✔ **Seamless background task execution.**

FountainAI’s microservices **must be designed to leverage this model** for enhanced performance, reliability, and scalability.
